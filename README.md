## üìà Scoring Algorithm

The buy signal is calculated using this exact logic:

```typescript
let score = 0;
if (rsi < 30) score += 2;           // RSI oversold = 2 points
if (macd.buy) score += 1;           // MACD crossover = 1 point  
if (priceNearSupport) score += 1;   // Support level = 1 point
if (fearGreed < 40) score += 2;     // Extreme fear = 2 points
if (volumeSpike) score += 1;        // Volume spike = 1 point
if (lowVolatility) score += 1;      // Low volatility = 1 point
if (sentimentPositive) score += 1;  // Positive sentiment = 1 point
if (macroPositive) score += 1;      // Macro factors = 1 point

// Buy signal: score >= 4
// Confidence: High (6+), Medium (4-5), Low (0-3)
```
